# Face tracker 

Tracks faces across multiple frames (under construction)

### Running the scripts
 * Put frames (containing the same number of faces per frame) in `Images` folder
 * Run `python face_track.py Y/N` to identify faces in frames and dump them into a '.json'
 * Run `python Graphs/make_graph.py file_name` to visualize results and find any correlation in their flow
